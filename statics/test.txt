anaesthesia explained

general anaesthesia

general anaesthesia is a state of controlled unconsciousness during which you feel nothing. you will have no memory of what happens while you are anaesthetised. a general anaesthetic is essential for a very wide range of operations. this includes all major operations on the heart or lungs or in the abdomen, and most operations on the brain or the major arteries. it is also normally needed for laparoscopic (keyhole) operations on the abdomen.

anaesthetic drugs are injected into a vein, or anaesthetic gases are given for the patient to breathe. these drugs stop the brain from responding to sensory messages traveling from nerves in the body.

anaesthetic unconsciousness is different from natural sleep. you cannot be woken from an anaesthetic until the drugs are stopped and their effects wear off.

while you are unconscious, the team in the theatre looks after you with great care. your anaesthetist stays near you all the time.
